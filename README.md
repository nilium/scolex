scolex
======

Scolex is a small project for testing out various ideas in C++11 and
potentially C++1y/14 (i.e., the draft standard or final depending on
when this is read). As such, it's not a library and it's not a program,
it's just a collection of code that I may be toying with before I add
it to another project.

Various code from scolex has made its way into [libsnow-common] in the
past, so it's likely to make its way there in the future as well,
depending on how useful said code is and whether it's applicable across
a wide range of projects.
